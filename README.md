COMP 440 - Course Project: Phase 1 | Spring 2024
This repository hosts the development work for Phase 1 of our COMP 440 course project, due by midnight on Friday, 03/29/2024. Our team is tasked with creating a desktop or web-based application that facilitates user registration and login functionality, strictly adhering to the requirements set forth by our course.






#Project Highlights:

Development Stack: Utilizes Java, C#, PHP, Python, or C++ combined with SQL for backend development.
Core Features:
Database Schema Creation: Implements a user table schema (username, password, firstName, lastName, email) with username as the primary key and unique email, ensuring SQL injection prevention.
User Registration and Login Interface: Enables new user sign-ups with fields for username, password (with confirmation), first name, last name, and email. Incorporates logic to handle duplicate usernames/emails and unmatching passwords.
Security: Emphasis on safeguarding against SQL injection attacks, with additional resources and methodologies referenced for securing the database interactions.
